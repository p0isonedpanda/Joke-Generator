Joke-Generator
==============

--Welcome to the Joke Generator made by p0isonedpanda--

This is not so much a generator, rather it is a random selection kinda thing. However you describe it.
As of right now, it's pretty bare basic but I will attempt to add new features as new versions come out.

Change Log
==============

v1.0

Main program released with bare basics

v1.1

Changed the way the program clears the screen

Fixed a typo

NOTE: As of v1.1, this will NO LONGER WORK ON MACS (probably maybe idk never tested it don't plan on doing so)

v1.2

Necro'd this old repo to *finally* clean it up since it's old and disgusting. Now using a list to store jokes, which has brought the line count down a bunch which is very nice. 16 year old me didn't realise that `os` is a lib that exists on all platforms, however I'm not sure if `os.system('cls')` will work on anything but Windows cause I haven't properly looked into it or tested it, not that you'd want to anyway. I'm only really cleaning this code up because it's been bugging me for ages now.
